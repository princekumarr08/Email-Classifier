Email Spam Classifier using NLP
This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It helps filter unwanted or suspicious emails based on their content.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train a model that can accurately detect whether an email is spam or legitimate.
The model learns from a dataset containing examples of spam and ham emails.

🧠 Features
Preprocessing of text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization

Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Simple input system to check whether new emails are spam or ham

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled examples of emails:

Spam: Unwanted promotional or phishing messages

Ham: Legitimate personal or professional emails
Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK / re (for text cleaning)
